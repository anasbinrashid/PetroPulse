The system uses the **PetroPulse** database schema:

### Tables:
1. **owner**: Stores details of station owners.
2. **station**: Tracks station information (location, capacity, earnings).
3. **worker**: Maintains worker details and associations with stations.
4. **schedule**: Tracks worker schedules and station timings.
5. **fuelstand**: Stores fuel inventory details, prices, and associated workers.
6. **supplier**: Tracks supplier details for fuel and maintenance orders.
7. **fuelorder**: Manages fuel orders placed with suppliers.
8. **maintenance**: Logs maintenance activities for equipment.
9. **orderdetails**: Tracks transactions between customers and stations.
